= Why You Should Implement Rich Snippets =
According to Google, rich snippets "extract and show more useful information from web pages than the preview text that you are used to seeing." Significantly, Google is using structured data open standards such as microformats, RDFa, schema.org to power the rich snippets feature. Google is is inviting publishers to mark up their HTML. Webmasters can find more detailed information about **Google's rich snippets - Products review** [here](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=146750 "Google Product Review").

= Google's Rich Snippets Testing Tool =
Once you install this plugin, and publish your first product review, you can use Google's Rich Snippets [Testing Tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets "Google Rich Snippet Tool") to check your markup and make sure that Google can extract the structured data from your product review post. This tool will display a preview of how your product review might appear in Google search results.
